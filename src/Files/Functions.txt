We are building an app that generates a recipe from the users input of ingredients.
We ask for input from our users and then using a library we generate a recipe for the user based on
ingredients provided.

Play Gordon Ramsay sound when a recipe is given, MP3 from Youtube.

Done:
We need to create a scanner for user input, this reads protein and gives a recipe (file reader)
File Reader
Javadoc (i.e ReadFile) - Jessica
Print recipe + URL
Somewhere a sound will play of Gordon Ramsay (play audio) - Andreas
List/sort

To do:
File Write - Anders
We need to create a recipe .txt - max 12 recipes
