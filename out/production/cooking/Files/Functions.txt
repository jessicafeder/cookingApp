We are building an app that generates a recipe from the users input of ingredients.
We ask for input from our users and then using a library we generate a recipe for the user based on
ingredients provided.

Play Gordon Ramsay sound when a recipe is given, MP3 from Youtube.

1. We need to create a recipe .txt - max 10 recipes
2. We need to create a scanner for user input, this reads protein and gives a recipe (file reader)
3. Somewhere a sound will play of Gordon Ramsay (play audio)
4. List/sort
5. File Reader/File write
6. Javadoc
7. Print recipe + URL
